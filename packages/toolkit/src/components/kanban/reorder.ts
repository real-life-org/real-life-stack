 * items with the old IDs would silently fall out of `itemsByColumn`
 * (default columns no longer carry those keys). This helper is the
 * read-time defense: legacy values get folded into the spec ID, and the
 * next `onMoveItem` call writes the new ID back, so items heal on first
 * interaction. Unknown values pass through unchanged — they're handled
 * by the column lookup like any other unmatched status.

 * `items` is the pool that defines the target column's current membership
 * (all tasks for a merged board, one group's tasks for a grouped board).
 * The dragged `item` is passed explicitly because it may come from outside
 * that pool — e.g. an external drop moving a task between groups.
 *
 * Returns one update per item in the target column: the dragged item gets
 * the new status, and every column member gets its `order` reassigned to
 * its index. Status matching runs through normalizeStatus so legacy items
 * (pre task/v1-enum) count as members of the column they are displayed in.
