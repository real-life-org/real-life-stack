 * Pure resolver behind {@link useItemPermissions} — exported so it can be unit
 * tested without React. Order: a non-writable connector grants nothing; a
 * connector with an authorization model is the source of truth (UCAN chain /
 * RLS flags); otherwise the default below.
 *
 * **Default: space members may edit each other's content.** Creator-owns was
 * never the technical model — every member holds the space key in WoT, and
 * the Supabase policy `edit item` has always allowed it. The UI merely hid
 * the button, promising a protection that did not exist while withholding an
 * edit that was already permitted.
 *
 * The exception are the three SYSTEM types, which carry a visible statement
 * BY someone: editing a foreign comment puts words in their mouth, editing a
 * reaction or a vote (a relation record) casts a ballot for them.
 *
 * This hook is UX, never a boundary — it only decides whether a button is
 * shown. The rule is enforced at the write ingress
 * (`assertMayMutateAuthoredItem`) and, where a server exists, by the backend:
 * Supabase RLS (migration 0009) and the GraphQL store reject it outright. In
 * WoT it cannot be enforced at all — every member holds the space key — so
 * there it stays a convention among honest clients.
