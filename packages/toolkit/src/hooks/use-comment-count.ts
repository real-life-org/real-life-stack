/**
 * Is there a conversation on this card?
 *
 * Number of comments on an item — the cheap counterpart to {@link useComments}.
 *
 * Cards only need "is there a discussion, and how big", not the threaded list
 * with resolved authors. Same observable as `useComments` (`commentOn`,
 * direction `to`), so both stay consistent and the connector can share the
 * subscription; per-card subscriptions follow the pattern reactions already
 * use. Counts replies too — a card should show that a thread exists, not just
 * its first level.
 *
 * Returns 0 without a connector or on connectors without relations, so
 * callers need no guard.
 *
 * @answers `number`
 * @without value — `0`
 * @group relations
 * @see story rls-foundations-hooks--relations
 * @see spec docs/spec/08-relation-records.md
