# AGENTS.md

This repository is agent-readable, but it does not require a specific agent runtime.

Read this file first, then read [docs/agent-workspace.md](./docs/agent-workspace.md) for detailed project context.

## Repository Purpose

Real Life Stack is a modular app and UI toolkit for local communities, commons, and decentralized collaboration.

The core architecture is:

```text
App Shell / Space Modules -> hooks -> DataInterface -> connector -> data source
```

The DataInterface and connector boundaries are the most important contracts in this repository.

This file is about contributing to the stack itself. If you are building an app **on top of** the published packages, start with [docs/templates/AGENTS.md](./docs/templates/AGENTS.md) and the machine-readable overview in [llms.txt](./llms.txt).

When code and docs disagree, do not silently invent a new rule. Prefer a small fix, a clear PR note, or an issue.

## Contribution Levels

Contributors do not need to use the `wot-agent-runner`.

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| L0 Human contribution | Normal PRs by people. Follow README, docs, tests, and review. |
| L1 Agent-readable contribution | Agent or human follows `AGENTS.md` and `docs/agent-workspace.md`. |
| L2 RLAP-compatible contribution | Task or PR states scope, checks, human gates, and unresolved questions. |
| L3 Runner-conformant contribution | `wot-agent-runner` creates task, run state, handoff, conformance report, and PR summary. |

The runner is optional. Clear scope, working checks, and human review are not optional.

## Spec is Source of Truth

[`docs/spec/`](./docs/spec/) is the **Single Source of Truth** of this repository. Before changing any code that touches items, schemas, modules, capabilities, connectors, or hooks: **read the relevant spec section first**.

- Item shape, fields, vocabularies → [`docs/spec/06-schema-composition.md`](./docs/spec/06-schema-composition.md) and [`docs/spec/schemas/`](./docs/spec/schemas/)
- Tags → [`docs/spec/07-tags.md`](./docs/spec/07-tags.md)
- DataInterface and ItemFilter → [`docs/spec/02-data-interface.md`](./docs/spec/02-data-interface.md)
- Capabilities → [`docs/spec/03-capabilities.md`](./docs/spec/03-capabilities.md)
- Items, Relations, Groups/Spaces → [`docs/spec/04-items-relations-groups-spaces.md`](./docs/spec/04-items-relations-groups-spaces.md)
- Space module contracts (Map, Calendar, Kanban, Feed) → [`docs/spec/modules/`](./docs/spec/modules/)
- Index of all spec docs → [`docs/spec/README.md`](./docs/spec/README.md)

**When code and spec disagree, the spec wins.** Either change the code to match, or change the spec deliberately with a PR note explaining the reason. Do not silently introduce new rules in code, hooks, or concept docs — they must surface in `docs/spec/`.

## Rules For Agents

- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Respect package boundaries. Connectors must not import from other connectors.
- Keep hooks thin. Business logic belongs in connectors, shared helpers, or explicit modules.
- Put shared data helpers in `packages/data-interface`.
- Put reusable UI in `packages/toolkit`, not directly into apps.
- Use type-only imports where appropriate.
- Do not touch generated output such as Storybook static builds unless the task explicitly asks for it.
- Do not write secrets, tokens, or private credentials into docs, prompts, tests, logs, or code.
- Do not auto-merge or make release decisions.

## Expected Checks

Run the smallest relevant checks for the touched area. Typical commands are:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm build:toolkit
git diff --check
```

If a check cannot be run, say why in the PR or handoff.

## Agent Handoff

Every agent-assisted change should make the following visible:

- what changed,
- why it changed,
- which files were touched,
- which checks ran,
- what remains uncertain,
- what needs human decision.

If the work uses RLAP or `wot-agent-runner`, include the task, run ID, PR summary, checks, and human gates.

These systems support agentic work, but they do not replace normal contributor judgment or maintainer review.

## Handbuch mitpflegen

Bei Änderungen an öffentlichen APIs, UI-Verhalten oder Deployment: prüfe
`node scripts/handbook/impact.mjs <Basis-Commit>` und aktualisiere die betroffenen
Seiten in `docs/handbook/de/`. Begriffe stammen aus `docs/reference/terms.json`.
Neue Stories folgen `docs/spec/code-and-storybook-mapping.md`. Nach dem Build
`pnpm check:docs && pnpm test:docs` ausführen. Übersetzungen dürfen erst nach
inhaltlicher Prüfung einen neuen `sourceHash` erhalten.
